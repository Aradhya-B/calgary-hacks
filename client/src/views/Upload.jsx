Translation, if I give you an mRNA, is it automatically going to be translated? Maybe the cell has a way to sequester the RNA to ramp it up in some way so that it doesn't get to the ribosome under some conditions, and under other conditions it does get to the ribosome, or some ways to block, in other manners than just sequestering it, but to physically block whether or not this message gets translated. Well, it turns out that there's a tremendous amount of that. It's, again, not the most common, but we're learning, particularly over the last couple of years, that regulation of the translation of an mRNA is important. There are, although I won't talk about them at length, an exciting new set of genes called micro RNA's, teeny little RNAs that encode 21-22 base pair segments that are able to pair with a messenger RNA and interfere in some ways partially with its translatability. And so, by the number and the kinds of little micro RNAs that are there, organisms can tweak up or down how actively a particular message is being translated. So, the ability to regulate translation in a number of different ways is important. And then, of course, there's post-translational control. "
